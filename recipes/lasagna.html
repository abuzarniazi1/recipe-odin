    <p>
        To make a mouthwatering lasagna, start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Next, cook 12 lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 diced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves, cooking until the onion becomes translucent. Add 1 pound (450g) of ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary. Stir in 1 can (14 ounces) of crushed tomatoes, 1 can (6 ounces) of tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

        In a separate bowl, combine 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Now it's time to assemble the lasagna! Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 4 lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them. Spread half of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles, then sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat these layers, starting with the meat sauce, followed by the noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, and another cup of shredded mozzarella. Finish by adding a final layer of meat sauce and a generous amount of shredded mozzarella on top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving, allowing it to set. Cut into portions and enjoy the cheesy, flavorful goodness of your homemade lasagna!
